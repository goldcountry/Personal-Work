using namespace std;

should be included in your code immediately after all preprocessor includes.

Use #ifdefs if you want code to run differently on different OS's.

int x = 3; Copy Initialization
int x {3}; Direct Initialization

int x {}; Explicitly requests default initialization; for ints this is 0.

If you avoid using pointers in C++, you cannot have memory leaks.

Data types have built in DEconstructors as well as contructors. These are implicitly called when a variable goes out of scope; thus, instead of having a garbage collector (like in Java), each object and variable is ITS OWN garbage collector.

C++ can pass by constant reference; this means that the argument cannot be altered inside the function.

C++ has strings! Woooooooo!

++i is always at least as efficient than i++, usually more efficient. 

vector[index] does not check for out of bounds exceptions.
